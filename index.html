                    Le Sserafim (/lə ˈsɛrəfɪm/ lə SERR-ə-fim;[4] Korean: 르세라핌; RR: Reuserapim; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by Source Music. The group consists of five members: Sakura, Kim Chae-won, Huh Yun-jin, Kazuha, and Hong Eun-chae.
                    Le Sserafim debuted on May 2, 2022, with the extended play Fearless, which broke the record for the highest-selling debut album by a K-pop girl group in first-day sales. It was followed in October with their second extended play, Antifragile, which became the group's first release to sell over a million copies and made them the fastest K-pop girl group to debut on the US Billboard 200. Both EPs' title tracks reached the top ten of South Korea's Circle Digital Chart and were certified platinum for streaming in South Korea and Japan.
                    Le Sserafim's first studio album, Unforgiven (2023), marked their first number-one album on the Circle Album Chart and their first top-ten album on the Billboard 200. The album's singles "Unforgiven" and "Eve, Psyche & the Bluebeard's Wife" peaked at number two in South Korea and were certified gold for streaming in Japan. The group's first English single "Perfect Night" (2023) became their first number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart, topping the chart for six weeks. In 2024, Le Sserafim earned their second number-one album in South Korea and top-ten album on the Billboard 200 with their third extended play Easy. The EP's title track was their first entry on the US Billboard Hot 100.
